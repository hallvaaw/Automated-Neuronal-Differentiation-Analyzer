# NeuroX

NeuroX is an image analysis tool used for analysis of microscopy images from 2d neuronal cell cultures. The pipeline is a series of Python and Jython scripts executed in succession by a Bash script. Important metrics in neurodevelopment such as cell body count, neurite lengths and neurite branching points are retrieved from images and analysed using Fiji.
